    "While it is easier to read the dataset into a Pandas dataframe and then PERSIST it into the database as we saw in the previous lab, it results in mapping to default datatypes which may not be optimal for SQL querying. For example a long textual field may map to a CLOB instead of a VARCHAR.\n",

    "Therefore, **it is highly recommended to manually load the table using the database console LOAD tool, as indicated in Week 2 Lab 1 Part II**. The only difference with that lab is that in Step 5 of the instructions you will need to click on create \"(+) New Table\" and specify the name of the table you want to create and then click \"Next\".\n",
